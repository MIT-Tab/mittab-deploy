Hello,

This email is a confirmation that your tournament has been created.

URL: http://{{tournament_name}}.nu-tab.com
Username: tab
Password: {{ password }}

Respond to this email if you would like me to change the password.

If you selected the option to add a test tournament, it will be available at the
url http://{{tournament_name}}-test.nu-tab.com, with the password "password".

Note: It could take an hour or two for the domain name to be configured. To
confirm that the server is working, try accesing it via its ip address:
http://{{ ip_address }}. If that does not work, respond to this email to let me
know.

Questions? Try reading the MIT-Tab Wiki: https://github.com/jolynch/mit-tab/wiki

It covers everything from importing data in bulk, pairing your round, and more.

If anything isn't covered in the wiki, just respond to this email and I'll get back to you. My phone
number is 813-469-0382 if anything urgent comes up.

Best,
Ben
