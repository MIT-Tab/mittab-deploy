Your mit-tab tournament <a href="{{ tournament.url }}">{{ tournament.name }}</a>
will be deleted on {{ tournament.deletion_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") }}.

If you would like to extend the tournament, you can do so
<a href="http://nu-tab.com/tournaments/{{ tournament.id }}/extend">here.</a>

If necessary, we can re-create the tournament from a backup, but it's safer to avoid
this scenario.
