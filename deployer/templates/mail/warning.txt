Your mit-tab tournament ({{ tournament.url }}) will be deleted on
{{ tournament.deletion_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") }}.

If you would like to extend the tournament, you can do so at
http://nu-tab.com/tournaments/{{ tournament.id }}/extend

If necessary, we can re-create the tournament from a backup, but it's safer to avoid
this scenario.
